Working on SVGs and CSS animations within a create-react-app.

I was starting a new job and feeling overwhelmed at the seemingly endless spaghetti code. I set out to make the most compact and minimal app I could.The idea being that some of my favorite music and artwork appears to be really really simple, and the tools used are surprisingly low. It's so easy to connect to and often times we can allow ourselves to overthink things.

I hope
